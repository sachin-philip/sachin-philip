# Hi there! Sachin here 👋🏽

I'm a husband, developer advocate, drone pilot and polyglot engineer working with anything I can get my hands on, with a specific taste towards web 🌎. My aim is to build experiences that make people's lives simpler. I leverage JavaScript/Typescript to solve web challenges, Python for tackling data problems/AI applications and exploring Rust for high-performance computing needs. With a practical mindset 🧠 and adaptable approach 🔄, I focus on creating efficient, real-world solutions that address current technological needs while staying open to emerging trends and innovations.
