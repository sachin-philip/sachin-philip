# Hi there! Sachin here 👋🏽

I'm a husband, developer advocate, drone pilot and seasoned polyglot engineer who has spent over a decade crafting breakthrough web and data solutions 🌎. My journey with JavaScript, Typescript and Python has evolved naturally into exploring how Claude MCP and LLM capabilities can transform user experiences and solve complex challenges in elegant ways.

I like to build solutions that make sense in the real world 🧠. I focus on creating efficient, real-world solutions that address current technological needs like emerging LLM innovations while staying open to emerging trends and innovations.
